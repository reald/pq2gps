<h1>PQ2GPS</h1>
<h2>Sending Geocaching Pocket Querys directly to GPS receiver</h2>

<p><a href="index.htm">german description</a></p>

<h3>How it looks</h3>

<center>
<table border="0"><tr><td><img src="h.jpg"></td><td><img src="e.jpg"></td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>Cache types will be displayed in map with related icon and shortname.
Tradional, multi, unknown and letterbox caches will be marked with a red X if
they are currently unavailable. Every waypoint contains difficulty, size,
terrain, gc waypoint code and name (until no space left).</p>

<h3>preconditions</h3>

<ul>
<li>recent version of gpsbabel</li>
<li>garmin gps receiver with map support (tested with vista hcx, 60
csx)</li>
<li>data cable</li>
<li>files pq2gps.bat, updateicons.exe, wpts2gps.bat, wpt2.style and
wpt3.style (see below)</li>
</ul>

<h3>one-time steps (windows):</h3>

<p>First, you have to load a user defined icon set to your gps receiver. 
The geocaching icons are in the file <a
href="icons.zip">icons.zip</a>. Extract them and send them with
 <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=545"> ximage
by garmin</a> to your gps reveiver.  The zip file contains the english (en) and
the german (de) filenames. Choose the directory that fits to your gps
receiver (backup the old icons first and look at the filenames).</p>

<p>Next you need the program <a
href="http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gpsbabel/gpsbabel-1.3.5-beta20080121.zip">gpsbabel
1.3.5-beta20080121</a> (or a more recent version. The current stable version 1.3.4
does NOT work.).
Download it and install it to your desired directory.</p>

<p>Copy the files pq2gps.bat, updateiconswin.exe, wpts2gps.bat, wpt2.style and wpt3.style
to the same (!) directory (<a href="#download">Download</a>).</p>

<p>If your gps unit does not have an usb port, you have to edit the files
pq2gps.bat and wpts2gps.bat. Change all "-F usb:" to your serial port ("-F
com1:" for COM1 and "-F com2: for COM2).</p>

<p>That were the most difficult steps. They have to be done only once.</p>

<h3>Sending a pocket query to the gps receiver (windows):</h3>

<p>Here we go: Plug in your device and power it on. Unzip a pocket query.
Click on 123456.gpx with right mouse button and choose "open with...". 
Choose "pq2gps.bat" as program. The pocket query will be processed and sent
to your gps device. Important: Do NOT choose the option "always open
filetype with this program"! The "open with..." option might disappear!</p>

<p>To send waypoints, too: Right mouse click on 123456-wpts.gpx, 
"open with..." and choose "wpts2gps.bat" as program. The waypoints will be
sent but without touching the icons.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous:</h3>
<p>Send bugs and experiency reports (e.g. successfully tested gps receivers)
to <a mailto:"sqrt@tildepipe.de">sqrt@tildepipe.de</a>.</p>

<h3>Other operating systems:</h3>
<p>
You can use any operating system that is supported by <a
href="http://www.gpsbabel.org">gpsbabel</a>. 
The second download file contains similar scripts for linux and mac.
You may need to change the devicename for your usb port in the *.sh files
(read the comments in those files).</p>
<p>The installation of the user defined icon set seems to have to be run on a windows
machine (just once). If you know (free) alternatives to ximage, please let
me know.</p>
